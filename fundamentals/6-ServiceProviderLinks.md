# Service provider links

## Provider links

- Internet Service Provider (ISP), sometimes referred to as a `provider`, is an organization that provides Internet Services. These providers provide Internet services at a commercial, residential or individual scale.
- There are several factors that need to be considered before deciding which type of Internet connection you need. Some of the most common factors you need to consider are speed, number of users using the service, cost, quality, location of users, support and service-level aggrement SLA (mostly in commercial environments).

## satellite link

- In Satellite Internet connection, satellites in the space are used to provide Internet services to the users. This type of connection is primarily used in remote/rural areas where it is not possible to have cable connections.
- Another recent application of Satellite Internet is Aircraft Internet. Some Airlines are now able to provide Internet services during the duration of the flight. They also use Satellite Internet services to accomplish that.
- It is slower compared to dedicated connections but highly useful in situations where it is not feasible to have a cabled connection.
- unbounded/bounded media
- it covers large geographical area

## Digital subscriber line(DSL)

- Digital Subscriber Line uses a telephone network to provide Internet services. It takes the connection from the phone wall jack using the telephone network. It operates on the frequencies that telephone lines don’t use, and hence both the phone and the Internet work simultaneously. DSL is able to provide high speed and good bandwidth because it uses a cabled connection. It is cheaper than a satellite connection
- It is used in home environment for most of the cases. using the dsl modems
- the DSL modems is used to make a connection to a `public switched telephone line(PSTN)`
- then these PSTN connects to the service provider using the `DSL add/drop multiplexer (DSLAM)`
- maximum distance from the dsl switch to modem is 18,000 feet or 5.5km after this its going to loose its signal strength
- it is of 2 types: `Symmetrical connection` provides equal bandwidth for upload and download. `asymmetrical` provides more bandwidth for download and less for upload since downloading rate is higher when compared to uploading for most users.

## Cable internet

- Cable Internet uses TV Cable connection to provide Internet services.
- It uses the coaxial cable used for TVs to connect to the ISP through underground cables. At the user’s end, these cables are plugged into a modem to provide Internet connection. Cable Internet is able to provide high-speed Internet, but one of the disadvantages is shared bandwidth among the neighbors, which can degrade the performance if multiple users are connected at the same time. In general, it is faster than DSL except when multiple users are simultaneously on the same lines.

## Metro-optical

- In a Metro-Optical connection, buildings spread over a large Metropolitan area are connected through very high speed Fiber cables.
- These cables can be leased cables or owned cables.
- This technology is primarily used by major Internet providers having multiple locations within a given area. Using Metro-Optical connection, they are able to connect their different locations creating a bigger network. This, in turn, helps them to provide faster and more reliable services to their customers.
- The goal of metro optical connection is to provide Fiber optical connection to the end-users as much as possible. This connection type is going to be one of the most common types of connections going forward as these providers scale and increase their reach.
