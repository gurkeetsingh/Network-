# Network Topologies

- A network topology can be described how the different devices on the network are connected. A network topology can either be defined as a `physical or a logical topology`, whereas a physical topology describes the network's layout and how the devices are connected. A logical network topology defines the different devices and how these devices communicate with each other.
- `vrtnetworkequipment-1-2-0-lo` a extension file for libreoffice draw used to draw the pysical network topology. we need this extension file because the libreoffice doesnt provide this as a default. in this Various types of networking equipment icons are displayed. These can be used to create a visual network diagram of a companyâ€™s network.
- A physical topology represents how the `physical layout` of the network appears in real life.
- A `logical network topology` displays how the different devices are connected to each and how communication between these devices occurs.
- there are several different types of network topologies. these are: `mesh, star(hub and spoke), bus,ring, hybrid`

## Networking connectivity models

- Networking types can be defined as how different networks are interconnected to each other. The main differentiator is the physical location and setup of the specific network.
