# Copper cable and connection

## Unshielded twisted pair

- in this we have a 8 twisted conductors. there are 4 pair of twisted cabling in this
- the twist within the cables help them to strenthen the cables resiliency to electromagnetic interference
- in the `shield twisted pair` the only difference is that the twisted pair of cable are wrapped around by a `foil shielding` to make it more reliable against the electromagnetic interference
- the `outer jack` is the outer part of the cable it is of different types: `plenum and non-plenum`
- non-plenum is the average outer jack cable which is used commonly it also known as `polyvinyl chloride(PVC)` and the other one is plenum cable, this is rated for HVAC(heated ventilation and air conditioning) and is more expensive than non-plenum.

TIA/EIA twisted pair categories:

- CAT here means category
- CAT3, application= ethernet, 10Mbps, distance= 100m
- CAT4, token ring, 16Mbps, 100m
- CAT5, fast ethernet, 100Mbps, 100m
- CAT5e(enhanced), gigabit ethernet, 1Gbps, 100m
- CAT6, gigabit ethernet, 1Gbps(10Gbps), 100m(55m)
- CAT6a(augmented), gigabit ethernet, 1 and 10Gbps, 100m
- CAT7(iso not tia), gigabit ethernet, 1 and 10Gbps, 100m

## coaxial cabling

- in this we have a single copper cable or conductor in the middle and have braided shielding around it

## Fiber cable

- it uses an optical light source
- it is a bounded media type, it is longest bounded media type
- its fast and expensive
- they are mostly used when we need to pass a large amount of information or data at a higher speed without any electromagnetic interface we use fiber cable. its more fragile

types of fiber optics:

- `single mode fiber optic cable`
- it has a greatest distance of bounded media around 80 km
- it has a `core diameter of 9 microns`
- it has a cladding diameter of `125 microns`
- `multimode fiber optic cable`
- it has a shorter distance than a single mode
- it has a core diameter of `50 or 60.2 microns`, so its bigger than a SMF
- the smaller the size or concentration of the core the more further the signal can transfer

fiber optics connectors:

- `fusion splicing` is used in the termination of fiber cable by using the connectors- `subscriber connector(SC) or lucent connector(LC)`. the lucent connector is half the size of the subscriber connector
- `straight tip connector`
- `mechanical transfer registered jack(MTRJ)`
