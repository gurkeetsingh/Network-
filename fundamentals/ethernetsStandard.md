# Ethernets standards

## explaining ethernet standards

- Ethernet standards, also known as IEEE Standard 802.3, is a guide with defined rules for setting up and configuring an Ethernet network
- In order to understand the standard Ethernet code, the following list shows what each digit in the various cable types means:
    1. 100: network speed in Mbps
    2. base: baseband signal
    3. TX: twisted pair over fast ethernet cable
    4. SX: short cable runs of fiber optic cabling transmitting at short wavelength
    5. LX: long cable runs of fiber optic cabling transmitting at long wavelength
    6. SR: short range
    7. LR: long range
